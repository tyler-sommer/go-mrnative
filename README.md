# go-mrnative
A utility to generate native Go language MapReduce applications using gobind.

This program can transform a Go application into a shared library, wrapped in a JAR with Java
bindings, ready to use on your Hadoop cluster.

## Why?

**This is a toy project.**

A sane person should use hadoop streaming to write MapReduce programs using a non-JVM language.

Applications generated by go-mrnative will work and probably even be fairly performant, however,
because a full Go runtime is embedded in each JVM instance, memory usage is an issue. Additionally,
copying data between the JVM and Go runtime can be extremely costly.


## How?

**This project is under development.**

It is already very easy to generate Java bindings to a Go shared library using `gobind` and
[gojava](https://github.com/sridharv/gojava).

go-mrnative takes this a step further, creating the boilerplate code necessary to make your
Go structs available to Hadoop MapReduce.
